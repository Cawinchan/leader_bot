# Board Game Tracker Bot

The **Board Game Tracker Bot** is a Telegram bot designed to make tracking board game sessions fun and efficient. Whether you're playing with friends casually or competing seriously, this bot records your games, calculates scores, and keeps leaderboards up to date ‚Äî with a touch of humor!

- **Manual Adjustments**: Add or subtract points from any player at any time, outside of a recorded game.
- **Humor Included**: Generates random comebacks like "You den lah!" or "Your mother gay" for lighthearted interactions.
- **Database-Powered**: Stores game data in an SQLite database for easy retrieval and updates.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cawinchan/leader_bot.git
   cd board-game-tracker-bot
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set your `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your-telegram-bot-token"
   ```

4. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

## How It Works

1. Use `/add` or `/add_auto` to record a game. The bot saves details (name, players, rankings, points) in an SQLite database.
2. **Need to penalize or reward points outside of a game?** Use `/adjust` (e.g., `/adjust alice -3 oversleeping`) to directly modify a player's score.
3. Check your progress with `/view` (for games) or `/view_adjustments` (for adjustments).  
4. Remove outdated entries (either game or adjustment) with a unified `/remove`.
5. Enjoy random comebacks or jokes using `/comeback` or `/dom`.

## Example

```plaintext
User: /add_auto
Bot: What game was played? (e.g., 'Catan')
User: Chess
Bot: Is this a 'solo' (1v1v1v1), 'team' (4v1), or 'pair' (2v2 or 2v3v2) game?
User: solo
Bot: Who played? Provide player names separated by commas.
User: Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave
Bot: Now enter the rankings for each player in the same order.
User: 1, 2, 3, 4
Bot: What is the date of the game? (YYYY-MM-DD)
User: today
Bot: Game 'Chess' on 2025-01-05 recorded.
Points awarded:
Alice: +6
Bob: +3
Charlie: +1
Dave: +0

User: /adjust Charlie 5 side-bet
Bot: 5.0 points have been subtracted from Charlie.
```

*(**Note**: If you use a negative number in `/adjust`, points are subtracted; if you use a positive number, points are added!)*
