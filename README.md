   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/board-game-tracker-bot.git
   cd board-game-tracker-bot
   ```

## How It Works

1. Use `/add` or `/add_auto` to record a game.

3. Check your progress with `/view` or `/leaderboard`.
4. Remove outdated entries with `/remove`.
5. Enjoy random comebacks or jokes using `/comeback` or `/dom`.
